* For question 2 and 5, one could use SELECT DISTINCT to show only unique pid's, its unclear in the question if that 
  was what you wanted.

1. select city from agents where aid in (select aid from orders where cid in (select cid from customers where name = 'Tiptop'));

2. select pid from orders where aid in (select aid from orders where cid in (select cid from customers where city = 'Kyoto'));

3. select cid, name from customers where cid in (select cid from orders where aid != 'a06');

4. select cid, name from customers where cid in (select cid from orders where cid in (select cid from orders where pid = 'p01')
	 AND pid = 'p07');

5. select pid from orders where cid in (select cid from orders where aid = 'a04');

6. select name, discount from customers where cid in (select cid from orders where aid in (select aid from agents where city = 
	'Dallas' or city = 'Newark'));

7. select * from customers where discount in (select discount from customers where city = 'Kyoto' OR city = 'Dallas');
